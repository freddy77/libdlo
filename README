libdlo README and Quick Start Guide
========================

Prerequisites:

 * Install a compatible libusb version (0.13)
    * on ubuntu - "sudo apt-get install libusb"
 * Plug in a compatible DisplayLink USB device

To start the build process, open a shell prompt (as the user who's home
directory the libdlo is installed into) and change to the libdlo directory
to run

  $ ./configure
  $ sudo make install
  $ make check

Make check will do some basic drawing on the DisplayLink device. 
The 'sudo make install' step will have installed libdlo.h, the main header, 
in your local include directory, and libdlo in your local library.

The tests run by 'make check' are in the 'test' directory.  If you 
run the tests by hand, they do require sudo.  So, to run the program
called test1, run "sudo ./test1"

Building the Doxygen documentation
----------------------------------

The libdlo library sources are comprehensively documented using the Doxygen
tool (which you will need to install, along with its dependencies). To build
this documentation, do the following:

  $./mkdox.sh

and the resulting documents will be (re)built, with the index page being:

  ~/libdlo/docs/html/index.html
